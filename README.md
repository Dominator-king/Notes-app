# Contribution to a notes app

[link](https://notesapprayy.netlify.app)

- This was a premade note app with no functionality
- I added the delete notes option
- custom note names (the first line acts as note name)
- the responsive notes such that the one latest modified jumps to top
- And most importantly, Saved the notes to firestore database such that the notes get saved
